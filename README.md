# PixelPeek_OCR
this project was made as a deep learning Major project for my college. This project features ocr capable of detecting tables from images and save them in a csv or docs format. there are two ocr models - pytesseract and paddleOCR. The model can also predict hand drawn tables and handwritten text.

Project Title: PixelPeek OCR

Description:
PixelPeek OCR is an open-source project designed to provide robust optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities for extracting text from images. This project offers a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to upload images containing text and obtain accurate text transcriptions.

Key Features:

Multiple OCR Engines: PixelPeek OCR supports multiple OCR engines, including PaddleOCR, Pytesseract OCR, and custom models, providing flexibility and enabling users to choose the best-performing engine for their specific use case.
Table Detection: The project includes functionality for detecting tables within images and extracting tabular data using layout analysis techniques.
Visualizations: Users can visualize the detected text and tables overlaid on the input image, facilitating interpretation and validation of the OCR results.
Customization: The project allows users to customize OCR parameters, such as language settings, image preprocessing options, and model configurations, to optimize performance for different types of input images.
Export Functionality: Users can export the extracted text and table data to various formats, including text files, CSV files, and Excel spreadsheets, for further analysis and processing.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the hui main script to launch the graphical interface.
Upload an image containing text or tables.
Choose the desired OCR engine and settings.
View and export the extracted text and table data.
